The Drupal 8 plugin extends Z-Ray to display information on all the various Drupal elements constructing the page, including modules, views, hooks, forms, and blocks, together with general information on the setup and the request.
The Drupal 8 plugin also defines the routing logic for Symfony requests - for better events aggregation in Zend Server, and improved results for URLs in URL Insight.
